cutoffs,"The boundary line on geographic distance or travel time, where two models are adopted on its two sides. If we are using poisson regression, negative binomial regression, or zero-inflated negative binomial regression, then we use exponential dependence on distance/time for near trips, and power dependence for far trips. Unit for cutoffs on distance is km. Unit for cutoffs on time is minutes."
AIC Far,The AIC of models for far trips.
AIC Near,The AIC of models for near trips.
Residual Far,The sum of residual squares for far trips.
Residual Near,The sum of residual squares for near trips.
AIC Sum,The AIC of models on the whole dataset.
Residual Sum,The sum of residual squares for the whole dataset.
