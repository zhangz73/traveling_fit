# traveling_fit
In this repo, I will provide a script that attempt different regressions to fit the traveling model. The regressions are: negative binomial regression, zero inflated negative binomial regression, and multinomial regression. The script can also be used to attempt linear regression and poisson regression, which can be accomplished by slightly modifying a few lines of code.
